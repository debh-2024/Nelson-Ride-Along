            <h2>About the Club</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2014, the Nelson Ride Along Club stands as a beacon of equestrian camaraderie and
                adventure.<br>
                <br>
                It was founded by a group of likeminded equestrians keen to go on weekly adventures.<br>
                <br>
                Every weekend, members converge upon the sprawling trails and verdant meadows that wind through the
                surrounding landscape. Mounted atop their trusty steeds, they embark on journeys that transcend the
                mundane and embrace the spirit of freedom. From novice riders seeking solace in nature to experienced
                equestrians craving the thrill of the open trail, each hack out promises an unforgettable
                experience.<br>
                <br>
                We believe in the importance of companionship on the trails. Riders are encouraged to bring a fellow
                enthusiast to share in the adventure, ensuring safety and camaraderie along the way.<br>
                <br>
                Beyond the thrill of the ride, the Nelson Ride Along Club fosters a sense of stewardship for both horse
                and habitat. Through responsible riding practices and environmental awareness, members champion the
                preservation of the natural beauty that surrounds them.<br>
                <br>
                As the sun sets on another day of adventure, riders return to the stables with hearts full and spirits
                renewed, eagerly anticipating the next journey that awaits them along the winding trails of Nelson.
